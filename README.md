# Testing 2.0 - CISC 499

Welcome to the Testing 2.0 project page!

If you've arrived here using the QR code, please take a look at the things in the following order:

1. To set up your environment, follow the set up process for either [Python](/python_setup.md) or Java. For Java, if you prefer IntelliJ, follow [this document](/java_setup_intellij.md). If you prefer Eclipse, follow [this document](/java_setup_eclipse.md). *We highly recommend IntelliJ!*
2. Each set up document will contain information about how to run your own simple testing code snippet. Follow along to familiarize yourself with property based testing and behaviour driven testing.
3. If you are interested in property based testing (PBT), check out [this writeup](/understanding_generators.md) to learn more about the unique paradigm behind test case generators with jqwik (Java).
4. At the end, feel free to explore any of our code!
